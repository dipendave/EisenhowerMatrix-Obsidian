## [2026-02-17 15:30] - Design Evaluation Polish (5 Items)

**Changed:**
- Overflow fade on task lists is now conditional — only shown when content actually overflows via `em-has-overflow` class toggled in `updateOverflowIndicators()`
- Inverted Add/Cancel button weight hierarchy — Add/Save is now solid (tinted background), Cancel is ghost (transparent with border)
- Per-quadrant colored submit buttons with `rgba(color, 0.12)` background and `rgba(color, 0.4)` border
- Empty state text updated from "Tap + to add a task" to "Tap + to add, tap a task to edit" for edit discoverability
- One-time mobile drag onboarding notice on first open: "Long-press a task to drag it between quadrants"
- New task highlight animation (`em-highlight-new`, 600ms ease-out background fade) confirms successful task creation
- Added `hasSeenDragHint` to `EisenhowerMatrixData` interface for persisting one-time mobile onboarding

## [2026-02-17 12:00] - Design Polish: Form Buttons, Overflow Fade, Dark Mode Q3

**Changed:**
- Form submit button changed from purple `var(--interactive-accent)` to ghost button with quadrant-colored border (matches + button style)
- Overflow fade gradient now uses per-quadrant background colors instead of generic `--background-primary-alt`
- Dark mode Q3 (Delegate) opacity dialed back from 0.10/0.20 to 0.08/0.18 for better balance with other quadrants

- 7 new follow-up screenshots in `screenshots/design-review/followup-*.png`

**Changed:**
- Updated `DESIGN_REVIEW.md` from initial review to follow-up format: documents what was fixed, verifies fixes via fresh screenshots, identifies 7 remaining polish issues (purple form button, always-visible date row, empty state spacing, overflow gradient color mismatch, dark mode Q3 weight, mobile button sizing, task card color tags)

## [2026-02-14 00:30] - Task Count Badges, Quadrant Overflow Fix, Delete Undo Toast

**Added:**

- Delete undo toast — 5-second Notice with "Undo" link that restores the deleted task
- `restoreTask()` method on plugin for undoing deletions
- Desktop Playwright project and overflow scroll test
- Overloaded-state fixture (8 tasks in Q1) for Playwright testing

**Fixed:**
- Quadrant content clipping on desktop when many tasks — added `min-height: 0` to `.em-quadrant` so CSS grid children can shrink and `.em-task-list` scrolls properly
- Mobile-only Playwright tests now skip on desktop project (added `isMobile` guards)

**Files:**
- `src/view.ts`

---

## [2026-02-13 23:50] - Fix CI peer dependency failures

**Fixed:**
- CI `npm ci` failing due to peer dependency conflicts from `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` (eslint ^10 vs plugins expecting ^9, typescript 4.7.4 vs >=4.8.4)
- Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` so CI resolves deps the same way as local
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` with clean dependency tree

**Files:**
- `.npmrc`
- `package-lock.json`

---

## [2026-02-13 13:00] - Plus Icon, Version Footer, Auto-Bump

**Added:**
- Version number displayed as faint footer text (`v1.0.1`) in the matrix view, read from manifest.json
- Pre-commit hook script (`scripts/bump-version.mjs`) that auto-bumps the patch version when source files are committed

**Fixed:**
- Add button "+" was not centered — replaced text character with Obsidian's `setIcon("plus")` SVG icon
- Added `padding: 0` to add button to remove default browser padding

**Files:**
- `src/view.ts`
- `styles.css`
- `scripts/bump-version.mjs`

---

## [2026-02-13 12:00] - Fix All ObsidianReviewBot Required Issues

**Fixed:**
- Use sentence case for all UI text ("Eisenhower Matrix" → "Eisenhower matrix")
- Mark all unhandled promises with `void` operator (ribbon icon, command, click/submit/drop/touch handlers)
- Command ID no longer includes plugin ID (`open-eisenhower-matrix` → `open-view`)
- Command name no longer includes plugin name (`Open Eisenhower Matrix` → `Open matrix`)
- Removed `onunload()` leaf detach — prevents resetting leaf position on reload
- Replaced deprecated `substr()` with `substring()` in ID generation
- Replaced `innerHTML` with `textContent` for drag handle (☰) and delete button (×)
- Removed `async` from `onOpen`/`onClose` (no `await` expression) — returns `Promise.resolve()` instead
- Made `drop` and `touchend` handlers synchronous, using `void` for fire-and-forget saves
- Moved inline `style.position/pointerEvents/zIndex` on touch clone to CSS class, dynamic props use `setCssStyles()`

**Files:**
- `src/main.ts`
- `src/view.ts`
- `styles.css`

**Files:**
- `styles.css`

---

## [2026-02-09 00:10] - Bottom Padding for Obsidian Nav Bar

**Fixed:**
- Eliminate quadrant (last in stack) was hidden behind Obsidian's bottom navigation icons on mobile
- Added 60px bottom padding to container on mobile so all quadrants are fully accessible when scrolled to bottom

**Files:**
- `styles.css`

---

## [2026-02-08 23:50] - Mobile Compact Layout & Keyboard Scroll Fix

**Fixed:**
- Keyboard opening on iOS hid the input field — form now scrolls into view when input is focused (300ms delay for keyboard animation)
- Redundant "Eisenhower Matrix" title on mobile (Obsidian already shows it in the nav bar) — now hidden on `<600px`
- Tightened mobile spacing: reduced container/header/form padding, smaller grid gap, compact empty states

**Changed:**
- Added `scrollIntoView()` on focus for add form and edit form inputs
- Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth iOS scrolling

**Files:**
- `src/view.ts`
- `styles.css`

---

## [2026-02-08 23:30] - Comprehensive Mobile Layout Fix

**Fixed:**
- Mobile content invisible or clipped when interacting with the matrix
- Root cause: `height: auto` on `.em-container` caused it to grow beyond Obsidian's fixed-height leaf (which has `overflow: hidden`), so content beyond the boundary was clipped with no scroll
- Also: `flex: 1` and `min-height: 0` on `.em-matrix-wrapper`, `.em-grid`, and `.em-task-list` constrained content height instead of letting it flow naturally
- Also: missing `box-sizing: border-box` on container meant padding extended it beyond the leaf

**Mobile layout strategy (new):**
- `.em-container` fills the Obsidian leaf (`height: 100%`, `box-sizing: border-box`) and is the **only** scroll container (`overflow-y: auto`)
- All inner elements (wrapper, grid, task list) use `flex: none; min-height: auto; overflow: visible` — natural content height, no constraints
- Quadrants stack vertically, each sized by its content; container scrolls when total exceeds screen

**Added:**
- 4 new Playwright tests: container fills leaf (not overflows it), inner elements use natural height, container is scrollable when forms are open (32 total)

**Files:**
- `styles.css`
- `tests/mobile.spec.ts`

---

## [2026-02-08 22:45] - Mobile Layout Fix & Playwright Tests

**Fixed:**
- Quadrants collapsing to thin colored bars on mobile — root cause was `overflow: hidden` on `.em-container` and `.em-matrix-wrapper` clipping content in Obsidian's constrained workspace leaf
- On mobile (`<600px`): container now uses `height: auto` + `overflow-y: auto`, wrapper uses `overflow-y: visible`, quadrants have `min-height: 80px`

**Added:**
- Playwright mobile UI tests (24 tests across iPhone SE + iPhone 16 Pro viewports)
- Tests cover: quadrant visibility, header visibility, tap target sizes, overflow behavior, form accessibility in constrained containers
- HTML test fixture reproducing the plugin's DOM structure with Obsidian-like constraints

**Files:**
- `styles.css`
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `tests/mobile.spec.ts`
- `tests/fixtures/matrix.html`
- `package.json`

- `src/main.ts`
- `src/view.ts`
- `styles.css`

---

## [2026-02-08 22:10] - README, Vault Auto-Sync & Dev Workflow

**Changed:**
